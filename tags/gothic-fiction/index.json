        "body": " The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafón belongs to a 4 book series called \u0026ldquo;The Cemetery of Forgotten Books\u0026rdquo;\nRating: 10/10 Review The story of this book is recreated in Barcelona around 1930\u0026rsquo;s - 1950\u0026rsquo;s, and it\u0026rsquo;s about the life of a boy who love books and thanks to his father he discovered a book that he is totally enchanted with.\nOver the story he tries to discover more about the author, his life and where is he along with why he cannot find more copies of his books around. Not only that but is also how the story from the past is totally linked to the life he is living in the present.\nThis novel is in my opinion a must for book lovers , it\u0026rsquo;s a non-stop read which let you dream about love, friendship and how loyalty and curiosity if not the passion about things let you discover a whole world around you and the authors you read about.\nThis book is by far one of the best if not the best I\u0026rsquo;ve read this year. I totally love it and cannot wait to read the other 3 books from the Cemetery of Forgotten Books.\nThe narrative of Zafón allows to be immersed as if you were there with the main characters, for example, the plot is developed through the streets of Barcelona, to me represent a bit more as I lived there previously and truly felt as I was walking the streets with Julian and Daniel, particularly Av. Tibidabo and Las Ramblas which are well known.\nFinally, as curious fact, I wanted to read this book for a long time and I picked it just last month, it turns out that meanwhile reading the book the author happened to passed away which is really sad but I\u0026rsquo;m happy I discovered him and get to know about him a bit more. He is one of the Spanish authors that his books are the most read after Don Quixote by Cervantes.\nFavourite Quotes  Every time a book changes hands, every time somoene runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.\n  In this place, books no longer remembered by anyone, books that are lost in time, live forever, waiting for the day when they will reach a new\n About the Author.

He is well known because of this Novel - The Shadow of the Wind - published as his first adult novel and acclaimed world wide, winner also of many international awards.\nHis work has been published in 45 countries and have been translated into 40+ different languages.\n"
