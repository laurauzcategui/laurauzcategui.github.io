      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote my first post on What is Machine Learning (ML) and How Programming paradigms have changed over time and describing some use cases/applications. This time, I am sharing how Machine Learning and AI can be seen from different perspectives, specifically covering the following two areas:
 How much human interaction is involved in the training process of different ML algorithms. How the training is performed.</description>

      <description>This is my first blog on Machine Learning (ML) and my journey through it. I’ve been quite interested in all things data from the very beginning of my career as a Software Engineer.
If you are interested in following baby steps on the journey to ML, its fundamentals and how you could start building projects with it, tag along and I’ll do my best to explain what I’ve learned so far.</description>
